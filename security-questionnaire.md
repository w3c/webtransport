# Security questionnaire in advance of W3C review  - https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/

01.  What information might this feature expose to Web sites or other parties,
     and for what purposes is that exposure necessary?

    - This feature allows web developers to establish WebTransport over HTTP/3
      sessions to servers. For the purpose this feature exposes the network
      condition and error information to some extent.
02.  Do features in your specification expose the minimum amount of information
     necessary to enable their intended uses?

    - Yes. Also, we're careful of not exposing information for endpoints that
      don't support WebTransport over HTTP/3 as much as possible. Please see
      https://w3c.github.io/webtransport/#protocol-security for details.
03.  How do the features in your specification deal with personal information,
     personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from
     them?

    - This feature itself doesn't deal with such sensitive information.
04.  How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information?

    - This feature itself doesn't deal with such sensitive information.
05.  Do the features in your specification introduce new state for an origin
     that persists across browsing sessions?

    - No. Also WebTransport doesn't interact with cookies and other persistent
      state.
06.  Do the features in your specification expose information about the
     underlying platform to origins?

    - No.
07.  Does this specification allow an origin to send data to the underlying
     platform?

    - Yes, the feature uses network interfaces and can connect to localhost
      if a cooperating server is running.
08.  Do features in this specification enable access to device sensors?

    - No.
09.  What data do the features in this specification expose to an origin? Please
     also document what data is identical to data exposed by other features, in the
     same or different contexts.

    - Arbitrary data sent from the server.
    - Network errors (mostly opaque).
    - Network information (indirectly).
10.  Do features in this specification enable new script execution/loading
     mechanisms?

    - No.
11.  Do features in this specification allow an origin to access other devices?

    - Yes, via the network.
12.  Do features in this specification allow an origin some measure of control over
     a user agent's native UI?

    - No.
13.  What temporary identifiers do the features in this specification create or
     expose to the web?

    - As long as a WebTransport connection is open, the server can uniquely identify the client.
      TLS session tickets may make it possible to identify the client across navigations. This
      is very similar to a WebSocket connection.

      The "pooling" feature, which is not yet fully specified, allows multiple WebTransport
      sessions to share a single connection. This is very similar to connection reuse in HTTP.
      The connection may survive navigation.
14.  How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and
     third-party contexts?

    - The feature behaves in first-party and third-party contexts in the same way. WebTransport
      notifies the server of origin of the context when a session is established, and we use
      network partision keys when creating or pooling connections.
15.  How do the features in this specification work in the context of a browserâ€™s
     Private Browsing or Incognito mode?

    - The feature doesn't interact with cookies, HTTP cache and authentication,
      hence the feature works as usual in such a mode.
16.  Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
     Considerations" sections?

    - Yes.
17.  Do features in your specification enable origins to downgrade default
     security protections?

    - Yes.
18.  What should this questionnaire have asked?

    - ??
